## Forgotten epidemics. A Final Assignment of a Master’s Degree

Starting on 17th October 2021, I was involved in Master of Data and Visualization Journalism (<a
href="https://mpvd.es">Master de Periodismo y Visualización de Datos</a>), a university training focused on how journalist can use data to do their job and how they can show different figures and charts appropriately.

The master has 10 modules, in all which students have learned how to manage a computer terminal, where we could
find data (even when they are not visible), how we can access, manage, edit, analyze, and visualize them using different tools, techniques and languages, with an open source and an open mind way of doing. We have also understood what the main principles are to follow when we must publish tables, the colors
correlation or typography styles. We also have learned new ways to edit pics, videos, and audio clips, and how to make interactive files.

Although it could be almost impossible to show all the things we have seen during 10 months, one of the objectives of this Final Assignment (or
Trabajo Fin de Master, TFM, in Spanish) was trying to experiment and work with a wide examples of tools, techniques, and learnings of this Master.

You could see the result of the work done at <a href="https://arantxaherranz.github.io/forgotten-pandemics/">Forgotten pandemics</a>

### The topic: Forgotten pandemics
As I explained on the website, Covid-19 has shown how important dataset are. During this outbreak, world has stopped its normal activity, what has
a huge impact, among other things, in other data collections regarding another pandemics.

One of the main difficulties of this job is related with the lack of updated information: it is shown as a disclaimer, but also as a report. It
would seem that Covid was more severe than other pandemics. But some figures demonstrated, for example, that only in 2020 as many children
under 5 years lost their lives because of malnutrition as people died with Covid during two years of this pandemic.

### Materials and methods
After reading and having a proof of concept of some of the most important pandemics in the world, I spent a huge amount of time looking for dataset
about this topic. WHO was a main source of information, but not the only one.

In some cases, not all the information was standardized, or the database didn’t have the information I was looking for (e.g. age of patients). As I
mentioned, one of the biggest problems was that the majority of datasets were not updated. Even worst, in some database the last year of
information included is not the same for all the countries covered. For other outbreaks, the datasets only included information about one specific
region, but not worldwide.

Some of these numbers were downloaded directly from the website. Another were included in PDF documents, that I downloaded through the terminal and
access to the information by the same way.

Separated in different directories, after a first revision of each database I worked with some of them through Python or R, having a wide
understood of the data. After that, I made some graphs to visualize these conclusions.

In this report are covered some data about Covid, Malaria, Ebola, Dengue, Cholera and Malnutrition, but there are still other illness that I would
like to be showed as well (diarrhea, tuberculosis, or HIV), although I haven’t got enough time to do it.

I looked for all the papers at PubMed related with some of this illness to understand how important these outbreaks for the scientific community are.
It could be a clear symptom of the relevance of science implication to make a cure and resolve some of the biggest health problems. With this
numbers I made a table using Inkscape. After save it as PNG, I've edited with Gimpse.

For sure, I would like to also have enough time to find the economics implications of these efforts: how many dollars of investment has
countries, organizations and pharma companies dedicated to find a cure to each of this illness. Specially because this data is not always as clear
as the dataset of cases and deaths.

I've also looked for and downloaded (again, using some terminal scripts shown during master) videos (with the
appropriate Creative Commons
licenses). With them, I made a clip with OpenShot and used it as the header of my website.

### Special thanks
This report would be impossible without the dedication and the topics that all the teachers of the MPVD has shown to the alumni. Thanks to all of
them for the implication during this course, for sharing their knowledge and the patient required in some topics and doubts.

Thanks also to all the experts that spend some hours with us in master classes and keynotes. I’ve learned a lot of every one of you and inspired
me in different ways.

And, also, I would like to thanks to all of my classmates: <a

Now that Data & Visualization Journalism has brought us together, let's not stop pursuing our careers.
